## Tracker

The name of our app is __*Tracker*__, we create a new form of control over the 🚕 radio taxis drivers to bring them greater security and reliable to line users and the radio taxi central has a visual way to asign a taxi to a nearby client for a faster service

## 💻 Tecnologies used 💻
We used:
* Ionic v5.4.16 (for the App mobile)
* Angular v14.0.4 (for the web aplication)
* Firebase
* Git

## 📋 Features 📋
* An App mobile and a Web app
* The app mobile continiously sends the driver ubication in real time
* The app Web can visualize in real time in a map the drivers that are connected at the same time
* The drivers had a code to login in the aplication, so it's not an open app
